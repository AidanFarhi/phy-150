# Notes

Most physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of these four things:

- Length
- Mass
- Time
- Electric Current

The two major systems of units:

- SI units (Metric System)
- English units (Imperial System)

### SI Units

| Length   |      Mass     |     Time   | Electric Current |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| meter(m) | kilogram (kg) | second (s) |    ampere (A)    |

### The Second

The time required for 9,192,631,770 Cesium atomic vibrations

### The Meter

The distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second.

### The Kilogram

The kilogram is defined in terms of the second, the meter, and Planck's constant, 
h (a quantum mechanical value that relates a photon's energy to its frequency).

### Precision, Accuracy, and Uncertainty

- Accuracy: How close your measurements are to the real value.

- Precision: How close your measurements are to each other.

- Uncertainty: How much your measured values deviate from the standard value.
