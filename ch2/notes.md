# Notes

## Kinematics

The study of motion without considering its causes.

### Position

Where an object is at any particular time.

### Displacement

The change in position of an object.

To calculate displacement: Δ𝑥 = 𝑥f − 𝑥0

Δ𝑥 = displacement

𝑥f = final position

𝑥0 = initial position

### Distance

The magnitude or size of displacement between two positions.

### Vector

Any quantity with both magnitude and direction.

ex) 90 km/h east

### Scalar

A quantity with magnitude, but no direction.

ex) 1.8 m tall

### Time

The interval over which change occurs.

### Elapsed Time

Δ𝑡 = 𝑡f − 𝑡0

Δ𝑡 = elapsed time

𝑡f = end time

𝑡0 = beginning time

### Velocity

#### Average Velocity

Displacement divided by the time of travel.

V = Δx / Δt = 𝑥f−𝑥0 / 𝑡f−𝑡0

V = avg. velocity

Δx = change in position

Δt = change in time

𝑥f = final position

x0 = starting position

𝑡f = final time

𝑡0 = starting position

#### Instantaneous Velocity

The average velocity at a specific instant in time
(or over an infinitesimally small time interval).

### Speed

#### Instantaneous Speed

The magnitude of instantaneous velocity.

#### Average Speed

The distance traveled divided by elapsed time.

### Average Acceleration

The rate at which velocity changes.

𝑎 = Δ𝑣 / Δ𝑡

𝑎 = average acceleration

Δ𝑣 = change in velocity

Δ𝑡 = change in time

### Instantaneous Acceleration

The acceleration at a specific instant in time.

### Solving for Displacement and Final Position from Average Velocity when Acceleration is Constant

av: avg. velocity

v0: staring velocity

v: final velocity

t: time

x0: starting position

x: final position

<hr>

av = (v0 + v) / 2

x = x0 + av * t
